# Battleship
User vs computer game - you have to guess where the ships of your opponent are on a 10x10 grid;
there are 3 types of ships, each player has 4 ships.

Ships for each player: 2 x minesweeper (2 spaces on the grid), 1 x destroyer (3 spaces), 1 x battleship (4 spaces).
Ships can be placed either horizontally, either vertically on the grid.

For now, it is just a console app - maybe in the future there will be a nice interface.
Also, there is not a game algorithm for computer player - just random guessing.
